      <p>
        This project, inspired by ”Text Generation,“ features a real-time interface for chatbots with various
        personality disorders. The aim is to help users gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics associated
        with ten different personality disorders, thereby enabling them to offer better support to friends and family
        who may be affected by these conditions.

        The MIDI controller acts as the physical interface, with ten sliders to adjust the intensity of each disorder
        and influence the robot’s appearance. It also includes five function-specific buttons. Face tracking enhances
        the robot’s expressions, making them more lively and interactive.
